            <h2>Japan offers up a real feast for travelers, with mountainside onsen (hot spring) villages, sleepy beach-lined islands, and buzzing megacities all on the menu.</h2>
    
            <ol>
                <li class="bold">Tokyo</li>
                <p>Tokyo is a city forever reaching into the future, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on densely populated, earthquake-prone land, adding ever taller, sleeker structures.</p>
                <p>It's Japan's top spot for contemporary art and architecture, pop culture, shopping, drinking and entertainment (and a tie with Kyoto for dining). But more than any other sight, it's the city itself that enchants visitors.</p>
    
                <li class="bold">Kyoto</li>
                <p>Kyoto, Japan's imperial capital for a thousand years, is home to more than a thousand temples. Among them are the monumental, like Kinkaku-ji (an exquisite pavilion sheathed entirely in gold leaf), and the meditative, like Ryan-ji, with its stark Zen rock garden.</p>
                <p>And temples are only the beginning. There's the culture of tea, which you can appreciate at one of the city's many elegant teahouses; the art of the geisha, those iconic performers of traditional music and dance; and also a rich food culture, including kaiseki (Japanese haute cuisine).</p>
    
                <li class="bold">Naoshima</li>
                <p>Naoshima is one of Japan's great success stories: a rural island on the verge of becoming a ghost town, now a world-class center for contemporary art.</p>
                <p>Many of Japan's most lauded architects have contributed structures, including museums, a boutique hotel and even a bathhouse - all designed to enhance the island's natural beauty and complement its existing settlements.</p>
                <p>The resulting blend of avant-garde and rural Japan is captivating. It has also inspired some Japanese to pursue a slower life outside the big cities, relocating to Naoshima to open cafes and inns.</p>
    
                <li class="bold">Mt. Fuji</li>
                <p>Even from a distance, Mt Fuji will take your breath away. Close up, the perfectly symmetrical cone of Japan's highest peak is nothing short of incredible. Dawn from the summit? Pure magic.</p>
                <p>Fuji-san is among Japan's most revered and timeless attractions. Hundreds of thousands of people climb it every year, continuing a centuries-old tradition of pilgrimages up the sacred volcano.</p>
                <p>Those who'd rather search for picture-perfect views from the less-daunting peaks nearby will be following in the steps of Japan's most famous painters and poets.</p>
